    <h1>Regular Function</h1>
    <p>The <strong>this</strong>keyword represents different objects depending on how the function was called.</p>
    <button id="btn">Click Me !</button>
    <p><strong>this</strong>represent:</p>
    <p id="demo"></p>
    <p>See the difference before and after the button is clicked.</p>

    <script>
      hello = function () {
        return "Hello World";
      };

      document.write(hello());

      //   Arrow Function
      hello2 = () => {
        return "<br>Hello World!</br>";
      };
      document.writeln(hello2());

      hello3 = () => "<br>Hello World!</br>";
      document.write(hello3());

      //   Arrow Function with parameters:
      hello4 = (val) => "Hello " + val;
      document.write(hello4("Iqbal"));

      //   THIS
      class Header {
        constructor() {
          this.color = "Red";
        }
        //Regular function:
        changeColor = function () {
          document.getElementById("demo").innerHTML += this;
        };
      }
      myheader = new Header();
      //This window object calls the funciotn:
      window.addEventListener("load", myheader.changeColor);
      //A button object calss the function:
      document.getElementById("btn").addEventListener("click", myheader.changeColor);
    </script>

    <!-- if you use var outside of a function, it belongs to the global scope -->
    <!-- if you use var inside of function, it belongs to that function.
    if you use var inside of a block, i.e. a for loop, the variabel is still availabel outside of that block. var has a function scope not a block scope

    let is the block scoped version of var, and is limited to the block (or expression) where it is defined. If you use let inside of block, i.e. a for loop the variable is only available inside of that loop.

    let has a block scope

    const is a variable that once it has been created, its value can never change.
    const has a block scope.

    <!-- Array method
    One of the most useful in React is the .map() array method.
    The .map() method allows you to run a function on each item in the array, returnin a new array as the result.
    In React, map() can be used to generate lists.

    const myArray = ["apple","banana","orange"];
    const myList = myArray.map((item)=><p>{item}</p>)

    <!-- Destructing -->
    <!-- Destructing is only take out the items you would like use from your array or object
    Destructuring makes it easy to extract only what is needed.
    -->
    <!-- before
    const vehicles = ["mustang","f-150","expedition"];
    //old way
    const car = vehicles[0];
    const truck = vehicles[1];
    const suv = vehicles[2];

    //new way
    const[car,truck,suv] = vehicles;
    if we only want the car nad usv we can simple leave out the truck but keep the comma:
    const[car,,suv] = vehicles;
    -->

    <!-- Destructing with function returns
    function calculate(a,b){
        const add = a+b;
        const subtract = a-b;
        const multiply = a * b;
        const divide = a/b;
        
        return[add,subtract,multiply,divide];
    }
    const [add,subtract,multiply,divide] = calculate(4,7);
    -->
    <!-- Destructuring Objects 
    Old way
    const vehicleOne = {
        brand: "Ford",
        model:"Mustang",
        type:"car",
        year:2021,
        color:"red"
    }
    myVehicle(vehicleOne);
    //old way
    function myVehicle(vehicle)
    {
        const message = "My" + vehicle.type + "is a "+ vehicle.color + " "+ vehicle.brand + " "+ vehicle.model + ".";
    }
    //with destructuring
    const vehicleOne = {
        brand:"Ford",
        model:"Mustang",
        type:"car",
        year:2021,
        color:"red"
    }
    myVehicle(vehicleOne);
    function myVehicle({type,color,brand,model})
    {
        const message = "My" + type + "is a "+ color+ " "+brand+" "+model+".";
    }
    -->

    <!-- Spread Operator
    The Javascript spread operator (...) allows us to quickly copy all or part of an existind array or object into another array or object
    
    const numbersOne =[1,2,3];
    const numberTwo =[4,5,6];
    const numbersCombined = [...numbersOne,...numbersTwo];
