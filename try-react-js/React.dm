React is sometimes refereed to as a frontend Javascript framework, is a Javascript
library created by Facebook. React is a tool for building UI components.

How does React work?
React creates a Virtual Dom in memory.
Instead of manipulating the browser's DOM directly, React creates a virtual DOM in memory, where it does all the necessary manipulating, before making the changes in the browser DOM.
React only changes what needs to be changed!

create-react-app includes built tools such as webpack, Babel, and ESLint.
